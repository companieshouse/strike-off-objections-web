      <p>Use this service to tell us why a limited company should not be removed from the Companies House register.</p>

      <p>You can only object to a company being struck off after the notice has been posted in The Gazette.</p>

      <p>Companies House must receive the objection at least 2 weeks before the notice expiry date.</p>

      <p>This service takes around 15 minutes.</p>
