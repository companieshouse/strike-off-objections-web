        Apply to object to a company being struck off
      </h1>

      <p>Use this service to tell us why a company should not be removed from the Companies House register.</p>

      <p>You can only object to a company being struck off after the notice has been published in The Gazette.</p>

      <p>Companies House must receive the objection within 2 months of the publish date.</p>

      <p>We cannot register your objection if the company has already been dissolved and struck off. If you have a legal claim to pursue, the company must be restored first.
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/company-restoration-guide#who-makes-the-application">Read the company restoration guidance</a>
        for more information.

      <p>This service takes around 15 minutes.</p>
